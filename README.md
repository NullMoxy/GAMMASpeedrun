</p>
- Run Starts when First Loading Screen Is Dismissed
- Run Ends When The Living Legend: Finish Quest Completes
- Timer Automatically Pauses On Loading (and I think if your game crashes (Don't take my word for it (Just don't crash lmoa)))

## Troubleshooting
If your game is crashing on launch look at the log file, you probably haven't run main.exe or started the TCP Server on livesplits.
